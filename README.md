An [ocurrent](https://github.com/ocurrent/ocurrent)-powered, website pipeline using [current-sesame](https://github.com/patricoferris/sesame) and a modified [unipi unikernel](https://github.com/patricoferris/unipi/tree/simple-kv). Feel free to fork and make your own if you want your site to be a unikernel, you should only need to change the front-end of the pipeline and the `data` directory of course.
